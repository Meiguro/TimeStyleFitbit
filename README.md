## Project Status

Note: I have ceased development on this project, as I no longer have time to work on it. However, if you'd like to take over development, I'd be happy to collaborate!

## What Works

The watchface runs on the Ionic, showing a default set of widgets and using the orange color with the Avenir font. It also contains a ridiculously fancy config page that uses black magickry to display live previews.

## What doesn't work

- The fancy config page doesn't actually do anything
- No weather support
- No Versa support

## Additional Mockups

Here are some of my mockups for the design
